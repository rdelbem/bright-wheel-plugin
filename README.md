## Hi, this is my code test for My Bright Wheel.

1. This is a WordPress plugin, intended to create a shortcode to embed a form the fetchs the hubspot api

2. It uses autoload to load classes by its namespaces

3. It is divided in three parts,
   a. A main class, which is located at src/BrightWheel.php
   b. A view, which is located at view/form-layout.php
   c. Assets, that can be find at src/assets/
   I. One js file called main.js
   II. A style sheet called styles.css
